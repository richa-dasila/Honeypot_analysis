# Honeypot_analysis
Forensic Analysis of cyber attack on network using deception technique

We have analyzed an attack on honeytrap, with the assumption that the attacker has root access and has entered the honey_trap, will he be able to download and upload files? How is his activity monitored? As honey_trap gave a log analysis of the attack, we filtered it out using a python script and visualized the data using Kibana. 
The motive of this project is to understand the working of honey_trap, which is an open-source system for running, monitoring and managing honeypots.
